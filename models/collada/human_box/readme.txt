So here I put a model with joints as shown in the image.
Exception made for those two bones resembling shoulders, all the other boxes a fully weighted to their respective bones.
This is because I've tried to insert also these bones which not direclty affect mesh, but other bones - which instead affect mesh - which could be good to experiment.
This is not animated, as I thought that, since the creature will react to human behavior, predefined animations would be forced, giving the sensation of having something highly predictable, which probably is not where we aiming: probably setting (a lot of) parameters corresponding to transformations could lead us to a better non predictable and smoother creature's behavior.
