So here is an idea of what the most expressive part of the creature could be.
I tried to give it an affordable aspect both for adults and children. I should texture it (also add some tech\mech mesh particulars) since its mechanical partz I see mostly being mapped rather than modeled, having in mind that hundreds of thousands of polygons are never the correct choice - even in NRT rendering.

But as usual it will be completely changed :D

Feedback, please.
